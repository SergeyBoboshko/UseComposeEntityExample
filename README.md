# UseComposeEntityExample

## Overview
UseComposeEntityExample is a demonstration project showcasing the power of **Compose Entity**, a concept designed to simplify Android app development using Jetpack Compose. This example focuses on the development of a directory (reference) with a tabular part, highlighting the automation of navigation and CRUD operations.

### Key Features
- **Rapid Directory Development**: Demonstrates how to quickly create directories with minimal code.
- **Automatic Navigation**: Automatically handles navigation between list views and detailed screens for adding, editing, and deleting elements.
- **CRUD Operations**: Simplified implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities without repetitive boilerplate code.

### Why Compose Entity?
The true value of Compose Entity lies not only in the speed of directory creation but also in the seamless and automated navigation across different windows. This allows developers to focus on business logic while the framework handles navigation and data management.

## How It Works
1. **Define the Entity**: Describe the fields and structure of the directory.
2. **Generate the Form**: The UI form for working with the directory is generated automatically.
3. **Automatic Navigation**: Pre-built logic takes care of transitions between views, such as:
   - List view of directory elements.
   - Add/Edit form for individual entries.
   - Delete confirmation dialogs.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
